# Predicting point-by-point winners in Tennis

This is a Python project utilizing pandas and scikit-learn to make predictions on winner of inidividual points in ATP Tennis matches. 

As part of this project, I organized and manipulated point-by-point data from more than 10,000 ATP Tennis matches resulting in more than 2 million rows of observations. Pre-processing of data included multiple label enconding, one-hot encoding using column transofrmations and scaling. Finally, I used multiple machine learning classification algorithms to make predictions and compared scores for each of them. Support Vector Machines with linear kernels gives the best prediction score with a 64% accuracy in prediction of points.

More details to follow.
