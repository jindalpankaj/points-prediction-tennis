This is a Python project utilizing pandas and scikit-learn to make predictions on winner of inidividual points in ATP Tennis matches. As part of this project, I gathered, cleaned and manipulated 1.8 million rows of observations from more than 10,000 matches. Pre-processing of data included multiple label enconding, one-hot encoding using column transofrmations. Finally, I used multiple machine learning algorithms to make predictions and compared scores for each of them.
